The Yoyodyne network is connected to the Internet, but&lt;br/&gt;a network firewall blocks incoming connections to most ports, particularly port 119, the news port.&lt;br/&gt;The firewall does allow incoming SSH connections, however, since the SSH protocol is secure&lt;br/&gt;enough that even Yoyodyne&#39;s rabidly paranoid system administrators trust it. SSH can establish a&lt;br/&gt;secure tunnel on an arbitrary local TCP port—say, port 3002—to the news port on the remote host.&lt;br/&gt;The command might look a bit cryptic at this early stage, but here it is:&lt;br/&gt;$ ssh -L 3002:localhost:119 news.yoyodyne.com&lt;br/&gt;This says &quot;ssh, please establish a secure connection from TCP port 3002 on my local machine to&lt;br/&gt;TCP port 119, the news port, on news.yoyodyne.com.&quot; So, in order to read news securely,&lt;br/&gt;configure your news-reading program to connect to port 3002 on your local machine. The secure&lt;br/&gt;tunnel created by ssh automatically communicates with the news server on news.yoyodyne.com,&lt;br/&gt;and the news traffic passing through the tunnel is protected by encryption" style="rounded=0;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">

When an SSH client and server make a&#xa;connection, each of them proves its identity to the other. Yes, not only does the server authenticate&#xa;the client, as we saw earlier when the server checked pat&#39;s password, but the client also&#xa;authenticates the server by public-key cryptography. [Section 3.4.1] In short, each SSH server has&#xa;a secret, unique ID, called a host key, to identify itself to clients. The first time you connect to a&#xa;remote host, a public counterpart of the host key gets copied and stored in your local account&#xa;(assuming you responded &quot;yes&quot; to the client&#39;s prompt about host keys, earlier). Each time you&#xa;reconnect to that remote host, the SSH client checks the remote host&#39;s identity using this public&#xa;key.&#xa;Of course, it&#39;s better to have recorded the server&#39;s public host key before connecting to it the first&#xa;time, since otherwise you are technically open to a man-in-the-middle attack that first time.&#xa;Administrators can maintain system-wide known-hosts lists for given sets of hosts, but this doesn&#39;t&#xa;do much good for connecting to random new hosts around the world. Until a reliable, widely&#xa;deployed method of retrieving such keys securely exists (such as secure DNS, or X.509-based&#xa;public-key infrastructure), this record-on-first-use mechanism is an acceptable compromise. &#xa;&#xa;" style="rounded=0;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
